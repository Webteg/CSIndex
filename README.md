# CSIndexbr

CSIndexbr (https://csindexbr.org) provides transparent data about Brazilian scientific production in Computer Science. We index full research papers published in selected conferences and journals. The papers are retrieved from DBLP.

# Input files

**All these script must be places in the "data" folder:**

* [research-areas-config.csv](https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/CSIndex/blob/master/data/research-areas-config.csv): list of   research areas covered by CSIndexbr. This csv file has two columns: 
  * research area acronym (e.g., se)
  * minimum size of the conference papers indexed in this area (e.g., 10).

* [se-confs.csv](https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/CSIndex/blob/master/data/se-confs.csv): data about the conferences and journals indexed in a given research area ("se", in this case; but each area requires a separated file). This csf file has three columns: venue name at DBLP ("booktitle" entry); venue name in the charts and tables generated by CSIndexbr; venue weight, as follows:

  ** 1: top-conference or top-journal
  ** 2: not used anynore
  ** 3: "regular" conference (non-top)
  ** 4: top-journal
  ** 5: "regular" journal
  ** 6: magazine or journal that accepts short papers
  ** 7: journals with low h5-index
