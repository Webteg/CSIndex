# CSIndexbr

CSIndexbr (https://csindexbr.org) provides transparent data about Brazilian scientific production in Computer Science. We index full research papers published in selected conferences and journals. The papers are retrieved from DBLP.

# Input files

**All these script must be places in the "data" folder:**

First, there are two "global" configuration files:

* [all-researchers.csv](https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/CSIndex/blob/master/data/all-researchers.csv): list will all Brazilian professors whose papers are tracked by CSIndexber. This csv files has three columns:

  * Professor name (avoid using "-" in names).
  * University (avoid using distinct names for the same university; e.g. PUC-Rio and PUC-RIO)
  * DBLP PID
  
* [research-areas-config.csv](https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/CSIndex/blob/master/data/research-areas-config.csv): list of research areas covered by CSIndexbr. This csv file has two columns: 
  * research area acronym (e.g., se)
  * minimum size of the conference papers indexed in this area (e.g., 10).

The following papers are specific of a given research area (i.e., each area should have all files listed next; although, in this list, we are using "se" as example):

* [se-confs.csv](https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/CSIndex/blob/master/data/se-confs.csv): data about the conferences and journals indexed in a given research area ("se", in this case; but each area requires a separated file). This csf file has three columns: venue name at DBLP ("booktitle" entry); venue name in the charts and tables generated by CSIndexbr; venue weight, as follows:

  * 1: top-conference or top-journal
  * 2: not used anynore
  * 3: "regular" conference (non-top)
  * 4: top-journal
  * 5: "regular" journal
  * 6: magazine or journal that accepts short papers
  * 7: journals with low h5-index

# Scripts 

**All these script must be called from "data" folder:**

* *./run se pl chi*: update the papers (and related data) for the listed research areas (se, pl, and chi, in the example). 

* *./runall*: update the papers (and related data) for **all** research areas

* *./rundblp*: download dblp files (xml, with papers) for **all** tracked professors

* *./runcitations*: update citations for for **all** research areas
