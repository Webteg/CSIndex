<h2 class="text-center">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    
<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke"> Who maintains CSIndexbr Brasil? </h6>

<p>CSIndexbr is maintained by the <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/">Applied 
Software Engineering Research Group</a>, from Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. 
However, the project results are not endorsed by UFMG or any Brazilian research agency. 
Just as importantly, we cannot assure the absence of flaws, errors, inconsitencies, 
and missing entries in the data provided  by CSIndexbr. For this reason, the use of our data is at 
your own risk.</p> 


<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">How CSIndexbr works?</h6>

<p> Papers are collected from <a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/">DBLP</a>. 
We only collect full papers, accepted in the main research track of the considered 
conferences.
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">How to cite CSIndexbr?</h6>

<p> Please cite this paper: <br>
Marco Tulio Valente and Klerisson Paixao. 
<I>CSIndexbr:  Exploring the Brazilian Scientific Production in Computer Science</I>.
arXiv abs/1807.09266, 2018. 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09266">[pdf]</a>
<a href="docs/bibtex.txt">[Bibtex]</a> 
</p>


<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">What is your definition of a full paper?</h6>

<p>It is a paper presented in the main track of a conference. We also apply a 
minimum page size threshold, such as: 

<ul>
<li> Software Engineering, Programming Languages, Information Systems, Databases, 
Web & Information Retrieval: 10 pages
<li> Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, Human-Computer Interaction: 8 pages 
</ul
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">Do you plan to cover short papers (including demos, tool papers, early research
 papers, papers in industry track etc)?</h6>


<p>No, the focus is on full papers, describing mature and carefully evaluated work.
Papers tracked by CSIndexbr should be viewed as journal-quality papers,
although published in conferences.</p>


<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">Do you plan to cover journals?</h6>

<p> Yes, but only after covering conferences in all CS research areas.</p>


<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">Why my paper is not listed?</h6>

<p>
Please, check if it is a full paper, published in the main track of the
conferences tracked by CSIndexbr, in the 
period 2013-2018. If this the case, please 
use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kz3F1fZIKtubWYiu1">form</a>
or open an 
<a href="https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/CSIndex/issues">issue</a> on 
GitHub, to provide data about your paper.</p>


<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">Which conferences are tracked?</h6>

<p> We do not intend to cover all CS conferences. The number we have in mind 
is 15 conferences per research area. </p>


<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">Why conference [Conf] is not covered?</h6>

<p> We accept suggestions to track other conferences. However, 
our main interest is on high-quality 
conferences, with good metrics and well-known sponsors (ACM SIGs, IEEE CS, etc). 
The conferences should attend the following criteria:
submitted > 100 papers; acceptance < 30%; h5-index > 20.
If you think this is the case of [Conf], please 
use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kz3F1fZIKtubWYiu1">form</a>
or open an <a href="https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/CSIndex/issues">issue</a> on 
GitHub, to inform the statistics about this conference in 2017.</p>

<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">How is the departments score computed?</h6>

Using this formula: score = A + (0.66 * B) + (0.33 * C), where A is the number 
of papers in top conferences; B is the number of papers in "near-the-top" conferences; and
C is the number of papers in the remaining conferences listed by CSIndexbr. </p>

<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">How do you define top and near-the-top conferences?</h6>

We combined an initial metric-based assessment with a qualitative judgment.
First, top conferences should have submitted > 180 and 
h5-index > 40. Next, we manually evaluated the conferences selected in each area. 
We checked whether each candidate conference T from an area A 
is distinct from the other conferences in A; we also require T to cover
a broad range of topics in A, instead of being a specialized conference. We
selected at most two top-conferences per area, with exceptions in the case of
areas that congregate distinct sub-areas, such as Computer Architecture & High Performance
Computing. Finally, we classify as near-the-top 
the conferences with metrics similar to the top-conferences of their areas.</p>

<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">How can I help so that CSIndexbr covers an research area X?</h6>

<p> Please, use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kz3F1fZIKtubWYiu1">form</a> to inform
basic metrics about the relevant conferences in X, in your opinion (see the required metrics 
in the Stats tab).</p>


<!--

<h6>What is your definition of research area?</h6>

<p> A research area must have a Special Interest Group (Comissao Especial) at SBC or ACM.</p>

--!>


<!---
<h6>Do you plan to track papers from other countries?</h6>

<p> Yes, we plan to encourage and help other groups to create CoreXX
projects, covering papers in countries XX. Our code is public on GitHub,
under MIT and CC licences.</p>
--!>

<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">What happens when an author moves from institution X to Y?</h6>

<p> CSIndexbr assigns all papers from an author to its current institution. Therefore,
after moving to Y, his papers are listed as belonging to Y,
even the ones produced when he was at X. The reason is that it is not trivial to
automatically keep track of the past institutions of each author in our database.
