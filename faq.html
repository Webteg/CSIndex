<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Who is behind CSIndexbr?
</h6>

<p>
CSIndexbr is maintained by the <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/">Applied
Software Engineering Research Group</a>, from Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
However, the project results are not endorsed by UFMG or any Brazilian research agency.
</p>

<p>
Just as importantly, we cannot assure the absence of flaws, errors, inconsitencies,
and missing entries in the data provided  by CSIndexbr. For this reason,
the <b>use of our data is at your own risk</b>.

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
How CSIndexbr works?
</h6>

<p>
Papers are collected from <a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/">DBLP</a>.
In the case of conferences, we only collect full papers, accepted in the
main research track of the event. We also collect citations from
 <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/cited-by/">CrossRef</a>
and links to preprints from <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> (see figure).

since it is the primary source of the data collected by CSIndexbr.
</p>


<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
What is your definition of a full paper?
</h6>

<p>
It is a paper presented in the main track of a conference. We also apply a
minimum page size threshold, such as:

<ul>
<li> Software Engineering, Programming Languages, Information Systems, Databases,
Web & Information Retrieval: 10 pages
<li> Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, Human-Computer Interaction: 8 pages
</ul
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Do you plan to cover short papers (including demos, tool papers, early research
papers, industry track papers etc)?
</h6>


<p>
No, in the case of conferences, we only collect full papers, describing
mature and carefully evaluated work; these papers
should be viewed as journal-quality papers.
</p>


<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Why my paper is not listed?
</h6>

<p>
In the case of conferences, check if it is a full paper, published in the main
track of the event, in the period 2013-2018. If this the case, please
use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kz3F1fZIKtubWYiu1">form</a>
and provide data about your paper.
</p>


<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Which conferences are tracked?
</h6>

<p>
We do not intend to cover all CS conferences.  Our interest is on high-quality
conferences, with good metrics and well-known sponsors (ACM SIGs, IEEE CS, etc).
Particularly, conferences should attend the following thresholds:
<ul>
<li> submitted > 100 papers
<li> acceptance < 30%
<li> h5-index > 20
</ul>
</p>


<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Which journals are tracked?
</h6>

<p> First, journals must be indexed by Journal Citation Reports (JCR).
    Second, we look for journals attending the following thresholds:
<ul>
<li> h5-index > 25
</ul>
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
What is the meaning of "other" in the journals Rank column (Stats tab)?
</h6>

<p> These journals are scored as conferences (weight 0.33, instead of 0.40).
  The following journals are classified in this category:
<ul>
<li> Magazines and journals that accept short papers (which must have at least 6 pages)
<li> Mega journals that accept more than 500 papers/year
<li> Journals with <i>normalized-h5-index</i> < 0.2
</ul>
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Why JCR's impact factor is not used for selecting journals?
</h6>

<p>
Because JCR has a restrict license;
for example "sharing of JCR data outside a subscriber’s institution
is strictly prohibited".
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
Why conference [Conf] or [Journal] are not covered?
</h6>

<p>
We accept suggestions to track other conferences or journals. However,
please check if they attend the thresholds defined in the previous
questions.
If you think this is the case, please
use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kz3F1fZIKtubWYiu1">form</a>
to inform the metrics about [Conf] or [Journal].
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
How is the departments score computed?
</h6>

<p>
Using this formula:


<ul>
<li>score = A + (0.66 * B) + (0.4 * C) + (0.33 * D) <br>
</ul>

where:

<ul>
<li> A = number of papers in "top" conferences or journals
<li> B = number of papers in "near-the-top" conferences or journals
<li> C = number of papers in journals
<li> D = number of papers in conferences or in "other" journals
</ul>
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
How do you define top and near-the-top conferences?
</h6>

<p>
We combine an initial metric-based assessment with a qualitative judgment.
First, top conferences should have:

<ul>
<li> submitted > 180 papers and
<li> h5-index > 40.
</ul>

Next, we manually evaluated the conferences selected in each area.
We checked whether each candidate conference T from an area A
is distinct from the other conferences in A; we also require T to cover
a broad range of topics in A, instead of being a specialized conference. We
selected at most two top-conferences per area, with exceptions in the case of
areas that congregate distinct sub-areas, such as Computer Architecture & High Performance
Computing. Finally, we classify as near-the-top
the conferences with metrics similar to the top-conferences of their areas.
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
How are citations collected?
</h6>

<p>
We collect citations using <a href="https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc">Crossref API</a>.
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a>
is an official DOI registration agency. Whenever a publisher asks
Crossref for a DOI, it must provide several meta-data about the paper being
registered, such as title, authors, date of publication, etc. Publishers
can also provide the DOIs of each reference contained in the paper.
In this way, Crossref is creating a database of citations; given a DOI,
this database stores other DOIs that cite it.
</p>

<p>
Other questions related to citations:

<ul>

<li> <b>Why are you not using Google Scholar citations?</b> Because they are
  "closed"; Google’s terms of service forbids data collection by bots
  or similar programs.

<li> <b>Why the number of Crossref and Google Scholar citations do not
  match?</b>
  First, because Crossref only considers citations coming from papers with
  a DOI. The second reason is because some publishers do not provide
  citations meta-data, when registering a paper at Crossref.

<li> <b>Who else uses Crossref citations?</b> Users include the Cited-by service
  of many journals (Wiley, Elsevier etc), scholarly search engines (e.g.
  Digital Science's <a href="https://www.dimensions.ai/">Dimensions</a>) and
  several other scholarly communication analysis tools (see a list in this
  <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-delivery/rest-api-users/">page</a>).
</ul>
</p>

<h6 style="background-color: WhiteSmoke">How can I help so that CSIndexbr covers an research area X?</h6>

<p> Please, use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kz3F1fZIKtubWYiu1">form</a> to inform
basic metrics about the relevant conferences in X, in your opinion (see the required metrics
in the Stats tab).</p>


<h6>What is your definition of research area?</h6>

<p> A research area must have a Special Interest Group (Comissao Especial) at SBC or ACM.</p>


<h6>Do you plan to track papers from other countries?</h6>

<p> Yes, we plan to encourage and help other groups to create CoreXX
projects, covering papers in countries XX. Our code is public on GitHub,
under MIT and CC licences.</p>

<h6 style="background-color: GainsBoro">
What happens when an author moves from institution X to Y?
</h6>

<p>
CSIndexbr assigns all papers from an author to its current institution. Therefore,
after moving to Y, his papers are listed as belonging to Y,
even the ones produced when he was at X. The reason is that it is not trivial to
automatically keep track of the past institutions of each author in our database.
